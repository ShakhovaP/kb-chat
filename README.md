## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

```
Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration details.

#### Running the Application
You have two options to run the application:

**Option 1**: Using Docker
```
docker-compose up --build
```
run ```docker-compose down``` to delete the containars

**Option 2**: Without Docker

1. Set up a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the backend:
```
uvicorn api.routes:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
or with python
```
python -m api.routes --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
4. Run the frontend (in a new terminal):
```
chainlit run ui/ui.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8501
```
## üìÑ Access the chat application
Visit http://localhost:8501 in your browser to use the chat.

After accessing the application, you can start interacting with the chatbot. The chatbot is designed to respond to queries based on the integrated knowledge base and provide NPS analysis and recommendations using uploaded Excel-files. 

## üß† Knowledge Base Enrichment
The application provides an endpoint to enrich the chatbot's knowledge base by uploading documents.‚Äã

#### Uploading Documents
1. Get URL to your document
You need a public URL pointing to the document you want to upload. You can obtain this URL in one of the following ways:

**Option 1**: Upload your file to Azure Blob Storage and generate a public (or shared access) link to the uploaded file.

**Option 2**: Use a URL from another accessible source, such as a YouTube video link, a publicly shared Google Drive or Dropbox file, or a direct link to a document hosted on a website.

2. Access the Swagger UI
Navigate to http://localhost:8000/docs to access the Swagger UI.

3. Locate the /kb-upload Endpoint
In the Swagger UI, find the POST /kb-upload endpoint.

4. Upload a Document
Click on the endpoint to expand it, then click "Try it out". Use the file upload field to select and upload your document and url field to provide the corresponding URL to your file. Supported formats may include, .pdf, .pptx, .mp4 etc.

5. Submit the Request
Click "Execute" to send the request. The document will be processed and added to the knowledge base.
